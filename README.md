# CPP - Community Discussion

This repository contains code explained in C++ community discussion which are organized on each Satarday.

We are building a strong community for C++ at "CPP-Community Discussion" forum. We are C++ developers from all experience level and believe in collaborating and learning together.

We do a community session on each Saturday in which one of our speakers gives detail information on any C++ topic.

As this is just a start, we are encouraging people to speak up on any C++ basic or advance topics but we welcome to those who want to present their own work.

This is a good place to show up your skills as there is no judge. If you have any issue, you can discuss in the forum. You can collaborate with others for any project you want to work.

I welcome everyone to join our community and
"Let's C++ learn together".
